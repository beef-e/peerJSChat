A small real time chat app built using Svelte and PeerJS

## Used technologies

- Scss, to easily create hand-made and good-looking CSS

### Backend, tools, libraries

- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), to manage the project structure
- [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com), to manage the connection between the users
- TypeScript, to easily and quickly write safer code

### Why did I build this?

This project was initiated to allow me to practically learn some Svelte and building something cool with it.
I assure you it worked!

It definitely needs some superpowers, listed in here:

### To-Do:

- Improve the reliability and generally the UX
- ✔️ Make the actual chat scrollable, allowing to see older messages
- ✔️ Create a confirmation of successful connection
- ✔️ Make the error alerts less invasive
- ✔️ Use the second Peer's avatar in the UI
- Possibility to create personal ID's
- Store older messages
- Possibility to send basic media
- VideoCall option
